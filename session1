Initialization:
Start with 1 city as starting point
generate a fixed amount of hamilton cycle
compute objective values of each path

Using backtracking

(no revisiting allowed)

Selection:
k-tournament selection

Variation:
crossover then mutation

crossover: keep shared parts in path and complete to obtain hamilton cycle
mutation: swap 2 cities in path and check for loop  (5 percent prob)

Elimination:
(λ + μ)-elimination
